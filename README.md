# Pair o' Dice Baseball

This is a Baseball game I'm making as my first major solo game dev project, as well as as a gift for my dad (who's been making simple dice games like these for years).

There are a bunch of bugs in there, and I know there's no user choice so it doesn't have much "gameplay," but I'm proud of the work I've done (and I'm also nowhere close to finished). 

Thanks for any and all support!
